                <p class="sec-desc azeret-mono-normal">It is quiet simple, really. I feel like web development is perhaps the easiest way to break into the development sphere of computer science. As a soon to be CSE graduate who has spent his entire university career focusing more on data science, I find my abilities in regards to the development side to be very lacking. With web development, I will be able to establish a solid enough base I can build upon while also ensuring I have a solid skillset I can apply in a professional capacity. To further elaborate...</p>

                        After 4 years I have come to realize that as I am now, I do not have the expertise or capability to break into the data science field. Going into big data would require me to do much more study and put in a lot more effort, which is not ideal for my situation where I need marketable skills that can earn me a living.

                    I have had multiple different people influence my decisions regarding my career choice. Aside from my very own maternal uncle who himself is a capable full stack developer, another person also inspired me. I have known of Jhankar Mahbub bhai for years now. I once wanted to even read the book "Programming's Zero to Hero" but I could not make the time to actually get down to the reading part.<br><br>
                    After talking with a friend of mine who had previously taken this course, I came to learn that Jhankar bhai has a full fledged web development course on offer. Which is why I decided to enroll in this course and make a humble attempt at becoming a webdeveloper
